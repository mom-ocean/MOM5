Where to start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A good place to start is the "doc" directory, where you
will find  "user" guides for the MOM.  

How to run the MOM tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MOM tests provided in exp directory divide in two types, 
both using the GFDL shared infrastructure (FMS) :

1. Solo models   : Run stand alone MOM Ocean model.
2. Coupled models: Run MOM coupled with GFDL ice model 
                   (besides null versions of atmosphere and land models).

To run Solo models:
	 a. cd to exp and run mom4p1_solo_compile.csh first.
         b. Modify the 'name' variable in the script 
            mom4p1_solo_run.csh to be the name of the test you 
            want to run. A list of available tests is included in the script.
         c. Get the required input data for the test from GFDL ftp site.
            You can get the info by running the script mom4p1_solo_run.csh
            and following the instructions.
	 d. Run mom4p1_solo_run.csh
         e. The results go into subdir name/workdir
         
To run Coupled models:
         Do the same steps above to mom4p1_coupled_compile.csh and  mom4p1_coupled_run.csh

To run EBM models:
         Do the same steps above to mom4p1_ebm_compile.csh and  mom4p1_ebm_run.csh



Warning: The Solo and Coupled run scripts have been tested only on 10 and 24, ia64 
         processors respectively. 
Warning: Some of these tests require a large disk space to save the input data.
         Choose a partition with enough space (1-2 G) to untar the code and data bundels.
Warning: If you want to use the same root directory for all three experiments we suggest to
         compile in the order of increasing complexity: solo -> coupled -> ebm .
         You may have to remove some of the existing .o and .mod files
         if you want to compile ebm experiment after the coupled experiment.
         E.g., you probably have to:   cd ../exec; rm mpp*.o mpp*.mod fms_io*.o fms_io*.mod 

Note:    IBM platform users might want to add the following line to the top of the run scripts 
             setenv LDR_CNTRL MAXDATA=0xD0000000@DSA 


Note:    The compile scripts provide the basic capability to use static memory allocation 
         which might be faster on some platforms. In that case you need to adjust the values
         of domain bounds properly according to the number of processors and layout.
