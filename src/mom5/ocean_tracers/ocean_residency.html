       This module is a superset of the ocean age tracer module. It may
       be used to reproduce the age tracer, but it can also do much
       more. Unlike the ocean age tracer module, here you may specify
       a 3-d field by specifying a series of "rectangular prisms".
       The grid cells which occupy this field may vary with time due
       to the variations in the thickness of the surface layer.

       You may also specify a 3-d field by choosing one of three mixed-layers
       (KPP, density-derived or buoyancy-derived). You may also specify a
       region based on a a range of a prognostic or diagnostic ocean
       tracer (such as all points with a temperature of 10-20 degrees).

       You may specify either the mixed-layer method or the tracer range along
       with the geographic specification. If multiple methods are used, then 
       the resultant field is the intersection of the two methods. In fact, the
       geographic method is always in use, and defaults to the whole ocean.

       There is an option of using the inverse of any method. This is sometimes
       easier to use than explicitly specifying the inverse. For instance,
       to get the temperatures outside of the range 10-20 degrees, one could
       specify the 10-20 degree range and set &lt;swap&gt; to true, or, specify two
       different regions, one less than 10 degrees and one greater than 20 degrees.

       By default, the values inside the specified region are set to a
       specified value each time-step (default is 0), and outside of this region
       the field is integrated over time in units of years (integrand is
       1/(365.25*86400) by default, but this value can be changed. The inner region
       can be forced to be 0 (or the user-specified inner value) at each time-step
       (the default), or it can be restored to this value at a user-specified
       rate (given in days), or, it can be left alone (not integrated or set to
       any value).
       
       Finally, since we are just integrating a specified field by a constant value
       (by default), it is simple to make that field a simple function of another
       tracer. This is the final option. You may specify a prognostic or diagnostic
       variable to be the integrand, and have it scaled by a constant. One case
       which has been done is to integrate irradiance in the mixed-layer.
       
       This module is split into several different modules. This particular module
       is the only one called from outside, and it makes appropriate calls to 
       the other modules to implement its features. This was done so that it would
       be easier to expand the features of the ocean residency, without cluttering
       the code too much. Ideally, this could all be done with classes, but there
       is currently no support for classes in Fortran (pre-F2003). The current
       modules are:

       ocean_residency.F90             This module, the control center, and also does the
                                       integrations and resetting in the inner regions.
       ocean_residency_meta.F90        Has specifications of the ocean_residency type
                                       and other utility routines. This is separate
                                       to stop circular references
       ocean_residency_ml.F90          Handles setting mixed-layer masks
       ocean_residency_range.F90       Handles setting the masks for the tracer ranges
       ocean_residency_integrand.F90   Handles setting the integrand to a non-constant
                                       value

       field_table namelist inputs:

       The following 6 arrays specify the bounds of boxes, the intersection of which
       will define the region where the integrand is set to restore_region_value. ALl arrays
       must have the same number of elements. If none are specified, then no region will
       be used, unless swap is true, which is a quick way of selecting the entire ocean.
       This may be useful when one really wants to use one of the other methods of selecting,
       such as mixed layer depth, or tracer range.

       Longitudes will be shifted to lie in the range 0-360 degrees. If the eastern side is
       greater than the western, then the selected region will consist of those grid cells from
       the eastern value to 360, and 0 to the western value. If the northern value is less than
       the southern value, or if the top depth is greater than the bottom depth, then
       an error occurs, and the model stops.

       Three special cases exist for the depth (which currently must be in meters).
       If the bottom value is less than or equal to zero, then the top box is selected. 
       If the top value is greater than the maximum depth, then the bottom box is selected.
       If the top value is negative, then grid cells within "the absolute value of the top value"  
       from the bottom are selected.

       Note that the geographic specification is used for all residency tracers, so either
       values for these 6 arrays must be given so as to select a region, or else swap must
       be set to true and no arrays given.

               east_bnd: array of boundary points of the eastern side of the box,
                         in degrees longitude (default: NULL)
              north_bnd: array of boundary points of the northern side of the box,
                         in degrees latitude (default: NULL)
              south_bnd: array of boundary points of the southern side of the box,
                         in degrees latitude (default: NULL)
               west_bnd: array of boundary points of the western side of the box,
                         in degrees longitude (default: NULL)
                top_bnd: array of boundary points of the top side of the box,
                         in meters (default: NULL)
             bottom_bnd: array of boundary points of the bottom side of the box,
                         in meters (default: NULL)

                   swap: if true, then select the inverse of the specified geographic region,
                         otherwise, just use the specified region (default: false)
                restore: restoring value for values in the defined regions
                         negative =&gt; do nothing, 0 =&gt; force to integrate_region_value,
                         positive =&gt; time scale in days to force to integrate_region_value
                         (default: 0.0)
   restore_region_value: value to set the mask to for grid cells within
                         the specified region (default: 0.0)
 integrate_region_value: value to set the mask to for grid cells outside
                         the specified region (default: secs_in_year_r)
            swap_module: if true, then select the inverse of the region from the specified module,
                         otherwise, just use the specified region (default: false)
            module_name: if set, then it will be used to select the alternate
                         method of selecting the region (default: ' ' -- only geographic
                         selection is used)

       For the following arrays, see the different extra modules for required and
       possible values for the module selected.

                 params: an array of real parameters which may be used for the method
                         being used for selection (default: NULL)
                  flags: an array of real parameters which may be used for the method
                         being used for selection (default: NULL)
                strings: an array of real parameters which may be used for the method
                         being used for selection (default: NULL)

       For the following arrays, see the different extra modules for required and
       possible values for the module selected to specify the integrand.
        int_module_name: if set, then the name of the module used to set
                         the integrand (default: ' ' -- integrate time, in years)
             int_params: an array of real parameters which may be used for the integrand
                         (default: NULL)
              int_flags: an array of real parameters which may be used for the integrand
                         (default: NULL)
            int_strings: an array of real parameters which may be used for the integrand
                         (default: NULL)

       Sample field table entries:
       ---------------------------

 "tracer_packages","ocean_mod","ocean_residency"
 names = age_surface, age_bottom_inv, kppbl_nil, kppbl_14d, kppbl_frc, kppbl_irr_14d, temp_15_20
 horizontal-advection-scheme = mdppm
 vertical-advection-scheme = mdppm
 units = yr
 min_tracer_limit=0.0
 /

       This is the same as the old age tracer with all surface
       values forced to zero
 
 "namelists","ocean_mod","ocean_residency/age_surface"
 south_bnd = -90.0
 north_bnd =  90.0
 west_bnd =   0.0
 east_bnd = 360.0
 top_bnd = 0.0
 bottom_bnd = 0.0
 /

       This integrates the age in the bottom box and forces to
       zero everywhere else (note that swap is true)
 
 "namelists","ocean_mod","ocean_residency/age_bottom_inv"
 south_bnd = -90.0
 north_bnd =  90.0
 west_bnd =   0.0
 east_bnd = 360.0
 top_bnd = 10000.0
 bottom_bnd = 10000.0
 swap = t
 /

       This integrates the age of the water in the KPP
       boundary layer, but lets the age outside of this region
       keep its value until it again mixes with the boundary layer.
       The module_name is set, and strings is set to pick the
       type of mixed layer desired
       (note that the global geographic area is explicitly specified,
       and that the restoring time scale is negative)
 
 "namelists","ocean_mod","ocean_residency/kppbl_nil"
 south_bnd = -90.0
 north_bnd =  90.0
 west_bnd =   0.0
 east_bnd = 360.0
 top_bnd = 0.0
 bottom_bnd = 10000.0
 restore = -1.0
 module_name = ocean_residency_ml
 strings = kpp_bl
 swap_module = t
 /

       This is the same as above, but forces the age outside
       the boundary layer to 0 with a 14 day time scale
       (note that the global geographic region is specified by
       setting swap to true, also note the value of restore)
 
 "namelists","ocean_mod","ocean_residency/kppbl_14d"
 swap = t
 restore = 14.0
 module_name = ocean_residency_ml
 strings = kpp_bl
 swap_module = t
 /

       This is the same as above, but forces age to zero outside
       the boundary layer (note that restore did not need to
       be explicitly specified, as the default is zero)
 
 "namelists","ocean_mod","ocean_residency/kppbl_frc"
 swap = t
 restore = 0.0
 module_name = ocean_residency_ml
 strings = kpp_bl
 swap_module = t
 /

       The following integrates irradiance in the boundary
       layer (note that the units needed to be changed for
       netCDF output purposes)
 
 "prog_tracers","ocean_mod","residency_kppbl_irr_14d"
 units = W-yr/m^2
 /
 
 "namelists","ocean_mod","ocean_residency/kppbl_irr_14d"
 swap = t
 restore = 14.0
 module_name = ocean_residency_ml
 strings = kpp_bl
 swap_module = t
 int_module_name = ocean_residency_integrand
 int_strings = irr
 /

       This specifies the region as the area with
       a temperature range of between 15 and 20 degrees
       (note that the params holds the variable
       range)
 
 "namelists","ocean_mod","ocean_residency/temp_15_20"
 swap = t
 module_name = ocean_residency_range
 strings = tracer_range, temp
 params = 15.0, 20.0

       Residency surface area specification

  west_bnd     : western longitude of residency region
  east_bnd     : eastern longitude of residency region
  south_bnd    : southern latitude of residency region
  north_bnd    : northern latitude of residency region
  top_bnd      : top depth of residency region
  bottom_bnd   : bottom depth of residency region

       To set the volumes, a number of namelists are read,
       each containing the above values. You may specify up to
       num_geog_region rectangular cubes bounded by
       (west_bnd, east_bnd, north_bnd, south_bnd, top_bnd, bottom_bnd).
       Any grid box whose center is in one of these volumes will
       be considered to be part of the volume where the
       residency is reset to zero every time-step.

       north_bnd may not equal south_bnd, and west_bnd may not equal east_bnd

       top_depth may equal bottom_depth. In that case, then whatever vertical
       box contains that depth will define the vertical range for the box

       If south_bnd &gt; north_bnd, then nothing will be done for that rectangle

       The initial surface area is empty, with the default rectangle
       setting the surface area to be empty

       More than num_geog_regions rectanglar volumes may be used to specify
       the volume by using more than one namelist
